Agar.io Singleplayer written in Python

Start it in console: $ python Agar.py

You play the red cell, the computer plays the blue cell.
Move with the arrow keys.

Rules:
If you're smaller than one of the big green cells you can eat them.
If you're bigger than them you shouldn't eat them else you will be poisoned.
If you eat one of the virueses which are in dark green you will be poisoned too.
If you're poisoned you're in dark green and you will lose mass for 8 seconds.

Information to the AI:
If you're too small the AI won't attack you.
Even if you are big enough, there is still a 33% chance that the AI attacks you.

There are also normal cells which are blue.
They dont do anything and you can eat them.

Extra:
If you press F1 you can change your size.
If you press F2 you can change your speed.
If you press F3 you can chose how much cells have to appear.
  The maximum is 2000 cells.
If you press F4 everything is like it was before.
